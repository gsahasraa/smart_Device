**Problem Statement:**

In today's world, personal safety remains a significant concern for individuals across different age groups and genders. Often, people find themselves in situations where they feel vulnerable or threatened, such as when a girl is at risk of harassment or assault, a boy is confronted by a group intending harm, or when the elderly and children face emergencies. In such moments of fear and hopelessness, the ability to quickly and discreetly seek help is crucial. 

However, the challenge lies in the fact that victims may be unable to communicate their distress or location effectively, leading to delayed assistance and potentially severe consequences. To address this critical issue, we propose the development of an IoT-based device called "ABCD," designed to empower individuals to swiftly alert nearby responders or authorities, providing them with real-time location data and the nature of the emergency. This solution aims to bridge the gap between the moment of distress and the arrival of help, enhancing personal safety and security for everyone.
